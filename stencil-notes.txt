Stencil.js spits out native, vanilla-JS web components.

BUT: These components have (vanilla) JavaScript added to them that enhances the web component experience by:

Loading component code lazily (i.e. source code gets only pulled into the page if it's really needed => This reduces the overall bundle size)

Loading required polyfills automatically for browsers that need it

Re-rendering the web (component) DOM efficiently (i.e. the DOM gets updated with as minimal impact as possible, to reduce the amount of work JS and 
the browser have to do)


-slots can be styled only on top level using shadow DOM
-For the deep level nested tag styling we use light DOM that is
by styling in the index.html file
